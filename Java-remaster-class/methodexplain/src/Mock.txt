 In many countries, today there are many highly qualified graduates without employment.

 What factors, may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?


 In present days many young and dynamic graduates are jobless. Its shocking to see many fresh graduates had invested their money energy on studies and end up in vain.

 Few factors are playing the major role for this situation. Firstly, the knowledge gap for the real world problem. Plethora of engineers are
 graduating each year and how many of them are having the quality of solving the day to day problems? Yes, very few. Major sink I'm seeing the practical
 classes are not enlighten the students to solve the out of book problems.

 Secondly, the curriculam is not competitive for the modern era. This generation education system should enrich and enlighten students to meet the
 world class expectation. However, the Universities are following the traditional syllabus. Most of the tools and techniques are not meeting the
 global education index and the labs are not equipped enough make the real engineers. The University grand comission has increasing the spending for
 each year out of which, how many collages are using the money for the fruitful outcome?

 With the above factors politics and money were squeezing the last few hops on the education system. The students are experiencing terribly misguiding
 and distract from the core of education by social media's. If the education institutions are paying an attention and put the ears on feedback and
 corrective messure, it will not be far to create the world class students.
